# Calculator Lab Solution

This solution follows along the ideas laid out in the stages for the lab with some refactoring. It will require you to examine how variables are being scoped differently and how we are taking advantage of storing information in the DOM.


## Explanation

* Why the stages?

> The stages had you doing things repetitively and with very little tricks. This an attempt to think in terms of bare bones fundamentals. It's not a great solution, but it works and it's up to you to refactor it further. 

* What was the point of all the alerts?

> Having an intermediate step where you just get an `alert` to verify that your code is working correctly before you continue will help you avoid compounding errors that are hard to debug. It also forces you to take smaller steps rather than a large one.
